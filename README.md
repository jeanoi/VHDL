### All the folders contain a file that describes the functionality of the code, and a _tb (testbench) file that will test the code's functionality, when running the code in any simulator, allways run the _tb file.

## Flip-Flop_D
The VHDL file is a description of a FSM (Finite State Machine) simplified with the logic circuit of a Flip-Flop_D.

## Function-one
This file contain the code for a one set function, simplified via Karnaugh Map and a 8x1 Multiplexer.

## Parking_Meter
The code inside this file is a description of a fully functioning Parking Meter, ready to be implemented through FPGA.
